    Alessio received his first computer when he was 8yrs old, nobody in his family knew
    how to use it but Alessio looked so happy with his new toy.
    Time passed and Alessio's room started to look more like a lab than a proper child room.
    Lots of his adolescence nights were spent coding and playing online games.
    After the university he worked as a software engineer but he always had production
    engineering tasks also.
    If not on a computer you may find him with his family, playing some board games or
    trying to fix gardening problems in his backyard.

  story: |
    Amy converts cups of tea to polished writing. While a technical writer by day, she makes math quilts and math art by night. She shares a tiny condo (crammed full of books) with her husband, their astonishingly terrible house panther, and a murderous tuxie catbeast.

    She reads constantly and voraciously, and adores everything from literary fiction to comic books. She's watched every existing film that won an Oscar for Best Picture or any of the Best Screenplay awards.

Seeing them go on to achieve high growth and great results is a huge motivator for her.<br>
    Her style is consultative - she brings a wealth of experience from a vast range of customers – national and international. She likes to brainstorm, overcome challenges and make suggestions to make things change. Working with a customer is about helping them on the journey to the outcome they want, not just about taking a journey. Her advice is born from experience that gets results, not just theories!<br>
    Really enjoy facilitating live sessions, round table discussions and standing in front of people in a workshop – for her it is important to be a practitioner, to be hands on and to help.

  story: |
    Achilleas has been using GitLab since version 2, back when the default
    username and password were not documented. He started actively
    contributing to GitLab in 2013, in 2014 he became a member of the core
    team, and ultimately joined GitLab in 2015.

    He was introduced to Linux in 2006 and since then he tried many
    distributions until finding Arch Linux which won his heart and has
    been using it daily since 2009. As an open source enthusiast he is
    contributing to many projects, and is mostly into System Administration.

    He likes traveling and attending conferences that promote the free
    software movement.

  remote_story: |
    At my previous employer, a small tech startup, we had the flexibility
    of working remotely one day per week. As an introvert, this was a great way for
    me to see how much more productive I could be in a comfortable, distraction-free
    location. I love GitLab's truly remote and asynchronous working philosophy. I've
    been extremely grateful to be able to work anywhere, be it in countries where I
    have family (Canada, Brazil, Bulgaria, New Zealand) or my cozy office with a cup
    of tea and a cat on my desk! I also always have social opportunities, including
    daily video meetings and chats, as well as meeting colleagues in person while traveling
    and at Contribute.
  story: 'Cassiana is passionate about working on the People team because it perfectly
    aligns with her love of helping all team members feel heard, understood, and supported.
    Cassiana loves seeking out new vegetarian food adventures, listening to comedy
    podcasts, re-watching all the rom-coms, pet rescue videos, and traveling the world.
    She also believes that laughter is healing. Her People Operations responsibilities
    at GitLab have ranged from supporting team members in the complete onboarding/offboarding
    lifecycle, to converting team members due to international expansion, and now
    with strategizing and implementing all People Compliance initiatives and projects.

    Chad has been doing coding, sysadmin, and ops for 30+ years, since the dawn
    of the web and before - from mainframes to the cloud. He has contributed to and
    created several open source projects. His hobbies include traveling, volunteering,
    learning Spanish, listening to and making music, and weightlifting/natural bodybuilding.
    Chad joined GitLab because their values are closely aligned with his own, and he believes in
    an all-remote culture. He is a happy user of the GitLab product for his own personal projects. A
    note on areas of "expertise" listed: "I'll never really consider myself an 'expert' in anything,
    but that's the nature of imposter syndrome and moving right on the Dunning-Kruger curve. I do know
    a few things about the topics of expertise I've listed, though (as well as many more), and at a
    minimum I can find someone else to ask ;)"

  remote_story: |
    I live off the grid in a rural valley and have worked remotely as a contractor for close to 2 decades so I've seen a lot.
    Many companies allow remote situations but the heart and soul of the company is still in an office and remote folks miss out on "meatspace" conversations and social events.
    Even for an all-remote company, GitLab does it well - leveraging appropriate technologies and good process to ensure as much as possible is
    accessible to everyone, no matter their location or time zone. Personally, I'm grateful to be able to hang out with my children,
    tend to my 100+ fruit trees, and pursue my hobbies... and still get heaps of work done in a richly connected social environment.

  remote_story: 'Even though I worked remotely for many years as a telemarketing consultant
    for my customers, I was always the "remote person" with others working from their
    office. I never truly felt part of the team. I also worked in a permanent role
    for a US-based company for four years with the EMEA team all working from home,
    but we were often out of the loop. At GitLab we are all on the same level; because
    we are all remote there is no ability to leave people out of the loop as eveything
    is written down which is a necessity in our async-working world, and it works
    seamlessly. GitLab is the best move I ever made.

    '

    architecture, coding, security and customer support. The chance to learn something
    new everyday and solve a problem gets me out of bed in the morning. I was born
    and brought up   in India, but I moved to Melbourne at 17 to build an independent
    life for myself. I love cooking, eating, reading true-crime stories and taking

  remote_story: |
    When I decided I wanted to move from Switzerland back home to the Czech Republic I found out that going to an office every day is problematic.
    I still wanted to spend weeks, maybe even months, in Switzerland and I definitely didn't want to take a vacation for that. At that time
    I found one of many benefits of remote work. It was back in 2016, since then I realized there is much more to this.
    And this is true especially at GitLab.
    Working for GitLab as a family-first company allows me to work while raising a small kid and still find time for plenty of my hobbies.
    I make use of the flexibility GitLab offers. I can travel and don't need to take a vacation for it,
    I can do sport or hike in beautiful mountains in the morning and work in the afternoon or late evenings.
    It also helps me to keep healthy relationships as I can meet friends for lunch or spend a day with my parents while working.
    Working remotely at GitLab simply supports me in leading a fulfilling life.

    global employees to work anywhere remotely. Enabling remote \nwork has been her

    \nherself for 15 some odd years she has helped to cultivate a remote friendly
    culture at GoTo as well \nas Ping Identity, both companies sharing a hybrid model.

    more \nproductive at home without the social distractions of in-person work that
    comes with an office job. \nWorking from home also allows me to keep up with life's

  remote_story: "Many years ago, I had a job that demanded 2-3 hours of driving every
    day. It was deeply stressful,\nexpensive, and invasive -- I had no feeling of
    a work-life balance. I was not especially happy,\nbut it was necessary at the
    time, and it was manageable enough. However, this became much less manageable\nwhen
    a close family member was diagnosed with a dangerous rare form of cancer, and
    I needed\nto be their caretaker. Under the circumstances, my employer at the time
    graciously allowed\nme to work from home while I tended to my family's care needs.\n\nBefore
    this story gets too somber, I'll reveal that this family member pulled through
    their treatment\nsuccessfully and they are still alive and well today, many years
    later. And it's not clear\nif that would have been possible if I was not able
    to be at home, administering medication and\ncoordinating their care while they
    were ill, weak, and vulnerable. \n\nFurther, once I began to work from home, I
    found I was often twice as productive. I was fully able to\nstill collaborate
    and participate with my coworkers, and I was not setting gallons and gallons\nof
    gasoline on fire simply to be in person in an office. Once I adjusted to this
    form of work,\nI decided I would not go back to traditional commute work.\n\nAs
    of the time I am writing this, I am a new team member at GitLab. However, I can
    testify\nthat GitLab is the company that has most figured out how to provide and
    manage\nremote work with methods that allow productivity and autonomy. The GitLab
    Handbook is full of gold in terms of practical\nadvice that gives insight into
    handling the nuances of working remotely."

    Lucas likes building tools to build more tools. He joined GitLab in 2019 after passionately
    using their products for many years.

    When not coding, Lucas is living in the Pacific Northwest, brewing his own beer, camping,
    hiking, practicing his handstands, and making too many jokes.

  story: 'Lukasz''s entire career was built upon a childhood dream - he wanted to
    have a computer since he heard this word for the first time. It took him 10 years
    from writing his first programs in Atari Basic to creating his first computer
    network when he was a teenager. Coming from network/security background, he was
    working in Support roles for over a decade (with some episodes in Sales and Procurement).

  story: Originally from northern Iowa, but based in St. Louis, MO nearly all of my
    adult life (while always pining for the mountains), I’ve been working with software
    clients and helping to solve their problems for nearly 20 years. My primary goal
    is always to understand my customers’ critical business issues and make it easy
    for them to purchase the solution. I live with my fiance Bob and our pup Posie.
    I love to cook and entertain, see live music, and to travel far and wide which
    typically involves a deep dive into local food and some sort of sporty adventure
    like rock climbing, mountain biking or skiing or whatever else the destination
    may have to offer.

    enable fellow developers is the thing which makes him more than happy therefore he has been
    contributing to different opensource projects like Rails framework and constantly reading the
    source of Ruby language to take the relay when it's his turn.
    Other than writing software, he is also doing scuba diving and trying to get instructor license.

  story: |
    I started out as a full stack developer spending many years developing Ruby on Rails applications.
    Moving into team leadership roles, I quickly learned that through the servant leadership model I am best able to
    help development teams be happy, productive, and ready to deliver.
    I live in New Zealand with my wife and children and love to get out on the trails to run.
  remote_story: When I started at GitLab I swapped a three hour round trip commute
    for more time with family. I used to get daily traffic reports and rail announcements
    warning of delays for commuters, now I get to be at home for meals with family.
    Being all-remote at GitLab means greater flexibility in terms of work hours, and
    has enabled me to work async with and learn from colleagues from around the world.

    The best part of working remotely at GitLab is how much better I appreciate

    Pedro has always enjoyed making fellow developers' lives easier and more productive,
    so GitLab is a perfect fit for him. He's worked remotely for the last 2 decades,
    initially in the industrial sector, and more recently on consumer apps such as Plex
    as part of fully distributed teams. You can find his professional background on
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedropombeiro/">LinkedIn</a>.
    When not spending time with his family, you can find him playing music (guitar and piano),
    hiking or skiing in the Swiss mountains.
  remote_story: |
    Except for two 3-year stints, my professional career has involved remote work in one way or another.
    Initially at an offshore office and more recently with 100% distributed teams.
    Working on an offshore office gave me some flexibility, but I still felt as the odd one compared to the main team.
    I'd miss out on learning and development opportunities that were tailored to the main team, along with many other opportunities.
    When I moved to Switzerland in 2012 I chose a quiet countryside city where there was basically a single big employer.
    After a while I started realizing that this choice was limiting my growth, as well as the kind of coworkers that I got to work with.
    Fortunately, in 2014, shortly after buying a lifetime subscription for a personal media streaming service called Plex,
    I received a newsletter in which Plex asked for software developers, without any restriction on location,
    and 2 weeks later I was moonlighting with them.
    The fact that my previous employer could no longer use the lack of other opportunities in the region as leverage to
    underpay and to not recognize its workers was a breath of fresh air for me, and it was clear I would likely never work
    co-located again. There are just so many advantages to remote work for me that the alternative is not even something I want to consider.

  story: 'With a background in AI and Software Engineering, how in the world was I
    not here before?  Oh, that''s right, prior to GitLab I was a Security Solutions
    Architect selling Application Security Software to the US Federal, State and Local
    governments and Higher Education Institutions.  That was fun too. In my free time,
    I like to read and watch SciFi (the non-scary, more futuristic stuff like CyberPunk
    stuff), Build model ships, tinker with computers and electronics.  All that when
    my two kids let me have time to myself.

    When not accidentally breaking things with rusting skills, he can be found at
    his local CrossFit box (it''s not a cult! Maybe it''s a cult...), reading, travelling,
    being indecisive about what game to play on which console and experiencing all
    the joys that Australia has to offer. Especially the coffee, beaches and food,

    Hi all, I am delighted to be at the fastest company I've ever experienced so far!
    Based in London, coming from Splunk and Intel, my previous focus has been in software development tools, IT security and big data, building out international sales from the UK.
    I spend my spare time with family, and we both (plus Thor the German shepherd) love tennis, downhill skiing, travel and languages.  I've done an RTW (round-the-world trip) but there are still places to explore!

  remote_story: |
    Working with other GitLab team-members around the
    world asynchronously means that I can schedule my work around
    family time, which I truly appreciate.

    Having previously worked one day a week from home, I knew the benefits
    in terms of productivity and flexibility which is crucial to enable me
    to contribute to my family life with young children. Going fully remote with GitLab
    has meant that I am able to send and pick up my kids from school every weekday, thus relieving the stress
    of rushing home and not having enough hours of the day. I am then able to split my day and
    work later in the evenings which is also my usual productive times. Thanks !
