      GitLab helps automate the deployment and release of applications, shortening the delivery lifecycle, streamlining manual processes, and accelerating team velocity.
      With zero-touch Continuous Delivery (CD) built right into the pipeline, deployments can be automated to multiple environments like staging and production,
      and the system just knows what to do without being told - even for more advanced patterns like canary deployments.

      GitLab CD support both declarative and imperative CD approaches that combined provide maximum flexibility to model your delivery requirements.
