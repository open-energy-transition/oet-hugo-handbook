The Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) [Team](/job-families/legal-and-corporate-affairs/environmental-social-governance/) creates and maintains GitLab’s Corporate Sustainability strategy and programs. This includes ESG disclosures and public ESG reporting, identifying and prioritizing key issues to advance GitLab’s social and environmental goals, and creating partnerships with nonprofit organizations that support GitLab’s values and mission.

## ESG Strategy

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices, although newly formalized in GitLab Inc.’s (“GitLab”, “we”, “our”) strategy, have been embedded into our work culture since our inception. Deeply integrated into our business philosophy, GitLab’s ESG strategy is driven by our [values](/handbook/values/) of Collaboration, Results, Efficiency, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, Iteration, and Transparency (CREDIT).

In December 2022, we conducted an ESG materiality assessment to determine which ESG topics are most important to our business and our stakeholders. Through engagement with both internal and external stakeholders, we explored which ESG topics have the greatest impact on GitLab’s business, and where we have the potential to have the greatest impact on the environment, society, and our global communities. Our materiality matrix was finalized in January 2023.

In 2023, we released our inaugural [FY23 ESG Report](/handbook/esg/) in the Handbook. The report includes information on our key ESG focus areas, our programs and policies, acheivements to date, metrics and targets, and plans for the future.

**SuitUp Volunteer Opportunities**

In Q3 FY24, GitLab and [SuitUp](https://www.volunteersuitup.com/) partnered to provide virtual volunteer opportunities for team members to make an impact on students around the world.

SuitUp is a 501c3 nonprofit that helps students prepare for life beyond the classroom and increase career readiness by partnering with businesses and schools to develop, organize, and implement engaging innovative business plan competitions in communities. SuitUp empowers students to discover their passions through experiential learning opportunities and mentorship alongside corporate volunteers.

Below are summaries of the events we held in August and October 2023.

1. College & Career Panel:
     - On August 2nd, we hosted a panel for students from We Lead Ours, a school in Oakland, CA. GitLab panelists shared what it's like to work at GitLab and in tech, their own career journeys, and discussed resources to help support the students’ journeys into the corporate world.
1. Virtual Competitions:
      - On October 11th, we held two virtual competitions with students from Kingsley Academy and Girls Inc of Alameda County. Coached by GitLab volunteers, students role played as CEOs of the company tasked with creating a new initiative with an accompanying marketing campaign that encouraged young professionals to begin their careers at GitLab. Each team pitched their ideas to a panel of GitLab judges and the winning teams came away with prizes.


#### In Kind Support

**GitLab for Nonprofits**

[GitLab for Nonprofits](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/nonprofit/) is an in-kind donation program that provides licenses and seats at no cost to eligible Registered Nonprofit Organizations.

GitLab for Nonprofits operates on a first come first served basis. Once the [annual donation of 5,000 seats](/handbook/legal/philanthropy-policy/#2-in-kind-product-donation) is met, the application will remain closed for the year.

**FAQs**

**What are the benefits of the GitLab for Nonprofits program?**

GitLab is a single platform for project management, collaboration, source control management, git, automation, security, and much more. Because it is easy to use, flexible, and all in one place, it is the best choice for nonprofits to scale their work. The GitLab for Nonprofits Program gives free licenses of GitLab to registered nonprofit organizations.

Nonprofits accepted into the program will be provided a free Ultimate license for one year (SaaS or self-managed) for up to 20 seats. Additional seats may be requested although they may not be granted.

**Who qualifies for the program?**

GitLab supports Registered 501c3 (or jurisdictional equivalent) Nonprofit Organizations in good standing that align with our [Values](/handbook/values/). A “Registered Nonprofit Organization” is one that has been registered with the local government or authorized agency within its applicable local, state, provincial, federal or national government.

GitLab prioritizes Registered Nonprofit Organizations that help advance GitLab’s social and environmental key topics that were defined in GitLab’s [2022 materiality assessment](/handbook/legal/ESG/). GitLab’s current social and environmental key topics are:

- Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging
- Talent Management & Engagement
- Climate Action and Greenhouse Gas Emissions

For the calendar year 2024, we will limit the in-kind program to 5,000 seats, which was approved by finance and the board in the [Philanthropy Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b40Z-5uVebZ05RQehn5qq86c2qP_0w8T40MrygP3VEU/edit). Each organization will be eligible for up to 20 seats. This will allow us to assist as many organizations as possible. This will be revisited throughout the year and adjusted as needed. Interested organizations who are new customers may request additional seats although the request may not be granted. To limit churn, current GitLab customers that apply to transition to the Nonprofit Program will not be granted a special request above the 20 seats.

**What are the terms of the GitLab for Nonprofits program?**

Upon acceptance, program members are subject to the [GitLab Subscription Agreement](/handbook/legal/subscription-agreement/). The decision to issue a GitLab for Nonprofits license is always at the sole discretion of GitLab.

**How does someone apply?**

Interested organizations need to visit the [GitLab for Nonprofits](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/nonprofit/) page and submit the [application form](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/nonprofit/join/#nonprofit-program-application).

**How are applications processed?**

1. Nonprofits apply on the [GitLab for Nonprofits](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/nonprofit/join/#nonprofit-program-application) page. Once the application is submitted, the Nonprofit will receive a message and a link to TechSoup, our verification partner.
2. The Nonprofit will then need to log in or create their TechSoup account. TechSoup provides a rigorous vetting process to ensure the nonprofit is eligible for the GitLab for Nonprofits program and meets all requirements.
3. If a Nonprofit is verified, TechSoup will notify GitLab.
4. GitLab will then undergo its own vetting and approval process.
5. Once all parties have verified and approved the Nonprofit, GitLab will send the instructions directly to the Nonprofit to redeem their license.
6. If a Nonprofit is not verified through TechSoup, TechSoup will provide details on how the Nonprofit can become verified.
7. If a Nonprofit is declined from GitLab, GitLab will notify the Nonprofit via nonprofits@GitLab.com.
8. Please allow up to 15 business days for the application and verification process.
