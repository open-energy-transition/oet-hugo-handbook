### AMER Time Zone Webinars & Labs


### Jira to GitLab: Helping you transition to planning with GitLab
##### April 16th, 2024 at 9:00-10:00AM PT / 12:00-1:00PM ET

GitLab offers robust team planning capabilities that work directly with the DevOps lifecycle. Keeping teams in a single application offers operational and financial advantages. Many customers inquire about what a transition would look like from Jira Software to GitLab to team planning. This webinar will start to outline the differences in functionality and advantages gained by using GitLab.

#### Hands-on Lab: Security and Compliance in GitLab
##### April 17th, 2024 at 9:00-11:00AM PT / 12:00-2:00PM ET

In this lab we will focus on how you can secure your application with GitLab. 

We will first take a look at how to apply scanners to your CICD pipelines in a hands-on exercise so that any vulnerabilities are caught as soon as the code is committed. 

Next, we will look at compliance frameworks and pipelines to show how you can ensure no one within your development teams is cutting corners and exposing your application.
