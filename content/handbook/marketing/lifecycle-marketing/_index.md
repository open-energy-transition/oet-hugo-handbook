## Overview
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

[Lifecycle Marketing](/job-families/marketing/marketing-campaign-manager/#user-lifecycle-marketing) is responsible for strategizing, executing, and optimizing a data-driven user lifecycle communications strategy and overall email marketing plan, including ongoing nurture email campaigns.

This role works closely across Marketing for all things email, and directly with the Product Growth, Data, and Self-service Teams to collaborate, plan, and prioritize communication to better engage GitLab users and progress them through the buyer and customer lifecycle. The lifecycle marketing manager will focus on user paths to revenue, including engaging free .com users, trial users, and paid users of GitLab.

## Communication
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

In line with GitLab's overall [communication guidelines](/handbook/communication/), lifecycle marketing managers work through MRs first and issues second (in order to preserve documentation), and our slack channel [#lifecycle-marketing](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02A0MT93DL) is used for team updated and quick questions.

The [#marketing_integratedmarketing](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C03HJQW0DLZ) channel is used for weekly check-ins and interaction with the larger integrated marketing team.

In between bi-weekly Lifecycle Marketing Team calls:
* **Updates** should be added to MRs when possible
   - Add to #lifecycle-marketing Slack
   - Begin with `UPDATE: <brief description>` (i.e. `UPDATE: Marketo segmentation live for sales segment`)
   - Include link to MR (preferred) or issue
* **Topics** that need input should be added as an MR when possible, with issues as a secondary option, and pinged in Slack with `DISCUSS`
   - Add to #lifecycle-marketing Slack
   - Begin with `DISCUSS: <brief description>` (i.e. `DISCUSS: Marketing tool champions`)
   - Include link to MR (preferred) or issue

### Meeting Cadence
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->


- Bi-weekly - Lifecycle Marketing Team sync (lifecycle marketing)
- Weekly - Email Stakeholder call
- Bi-weekly - Digital Strategy sync
- Bi-weekly - Integrated Marketing sync
- Monthly - Marketing All-Hands (all marketing)

### The Handbook
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Is our single source of truth (SSoT) for processes and relevant links

- Individual teams should link back to these SSoT sections to avoid confusion
- Collaborative tactics contain their own handbook pages
- The handbook will be iterated on as we establish and optimize processes for optimal efficiency

## Project Management
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->


### Prioritization
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

1. [Lifecycle Marketing - Prioritization](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/-/boards/2532209?&label_name[]=mktg-demandgen)
   - At start of milestone, ensure that issues are in the proper category of prioritization. Align them to the [priority definitions](/handbook/marketing/lifecycle-marketing/#prioritization-labels).
   - Consider the time you have available in a 2 week period, recognizing meeting commitments and planned PTO.
   - Only add issues to account for 70% of your available work hours. Don't max out at 100% since there will likely be things that arise and need immediate attention throughout milestone.
   - *Ask yourself: considering realistic time this milestone, am I overcommitting? The first to drop from a milestone should be "Low" priority issues based on [definitions](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/#prioritization-labels).*
   - Discuss milestone with Jackie and if you need help determining what to drop and how to communicate (potentially) to issue requestors.
1. [Lifecycle Marketing - Current Milestone](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/-/boards/2574635?milestone_title=%23started&)
   - Minimize the "Low" and "Medium" columns. Your focus should first be on the "Top" and "High" priority issues.
   - Prioritize completion of "Top" priority issues, then "High" priority issues.

### Labels
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

#### Prioritization labels
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

- `DG-Priority::Top`: Immediate action needed, aligned to OKRs. This category will be limited because not everything can be a priority. Timeframe: Immediate action needed.
- `DG-Priority::High`: Not requiring immediate action, but aligned to OKRs, intelligent nurture, or free user journey. Timeframe: Within weeks.
- `DG-Priority::Med`: Requests submitted that align to OKRs, intelligent nurture, or free user journey. Process improvements to fix broken processes, or improve lifecycle marketing team efficiency. Timeframe: Within months.
- `DG-Priority::Low`: Requests submitted that would be helpful, but can be pushed for higher priority issues. Nice-to-have improvements for lifecycle marketing team processes. Timeframe: No specific timeline.
- `DG-Priority::ToBePrioritized`: Requests that have not yet been prioritized by the team.

#### Team labels
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

* `mktg-demandgen`: DRI is in Demand Gen team
* `dg-lifecycle`: DRI is in Lifecycle Marketing
* `dg-campaigns`: DRI is in Campaigns Team
* `dg-request`: Issue requesting Lifecycle Marketing support (did not originate from DRI team)

#### Status labels
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

- `mktg-status::blocked`: there were insufficient details in the issue for work to be completed
- `mktg-status::wip`: the issue is assigned and moved into appropriate time-based milestone
- `mktg-status::plan`: this is used for work that is in an earlier stage of planning and a specific request has not been made
    - This will likely be used mainly by campaign managers on issues that are not high priority but there is a desire to capture the idea/notes.

### Issue Templates
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

We ask that teams request work using the following issue templates in the campaigns project. These templates more clearly indicate what information and details are required in order for the request to be triaged.

Note on timelines: The campaigns team is focused on campaign strategy, execution, and optimization. Team member milestones focus on work to drive MQLs and SAOs, and requests will be committed to as bandwidth permits at discretion of Campaign Team Manager.

#### Request Issue Templates

#### Fundamental principles of issue requests
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

The following issue templates are used by the campaigns team to organize their work, with appropriate labels applied for project management.

- `/assign @` - issues should have only DRI based on who will complete the work in the issue. If work needs to be completed by multiple people, consider breaking into separate issues with clear deliverables and due dates. (example: `/assign @aklatzkin`)
- `/due 2021-` - add due date based on workback schedules (example: `/due 2020-07-13` or `/due tomorrow` or `/due 07/13/2020`)
- `/milestone %` - add milestone based on the due date of the issue (example: `/milestone %"Mktg: ` )
- `/weight ` - add weight between 1-5, with 1 being easiest (between 1-4 hours of time) and 5 being most complex (a full week of work). The majority of issues should fall into 1-2. If estimation is weight of 3+, break into separate issues for more manageable pieces to fit into milestones. (example: `/weight 1`)
- `/epic ` - add epic of the overarching campaign or project to keep things organized. In almost all cases, there is a larger initiative that the issue relates to, so it is best practice to associate issues to the most relevant epic for visibility. (example: `/epic [https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/370](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/370)`)

#### Intake process daily/weekly steps
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Team manager completes daily review of [lifecycle marketing issues in triage](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/issues/?sort=milestone_due_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=lifecycle-mktg&label_name%5B%5D=mktg-status%3A%3Atriage&first_page_size=20) assessing the following standards:
* Are all details in the `Submitter Checklist` sufficiently complete in order to begin work?
  - if yes, check that due date is at least 5 business days from date submitter details provided, move to `mktg-status::wip`, assign based on triage diagram, and put in current milestone (to be adjusted as needed by assignee)
  - if no, comment to requester and move to `mktg-status::blocked`
* Does the request align to OKRs and key projects?
 - if no, consider realistic timeline given priorities (and share with requester in comments, set up time to discuss if needed)

#### Shortcut issue comments for project management
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

**When a team member is picking up an issue from the backlog:**

```
/label ~"mktg-status::wip" 
/assign @
/milestone %Mktg:2023-
```

This will change the status to wip (work in progress), allow quick assignment and add to the appropriate milestone.

### Milestones
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

The lifecycle marketing team uses the overall 2-week marketing milestones (format of [Mktg: YYYY-MM-DD](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/milestones?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_title=mktg%3A+&state=&sort=)) to organize, prioritize, and balance campaigns, projects, and requests.

- The date in the milestone name is the END date of miltesone (Sunday)
- Note: Use of milestones was introduced to the campaigns and lifecycle team as of 2020-07-21.
- If issues in a milestone are not closed out by end of milestone, they are pulled to the next milestone. We will document **total issues** and **total weight** moved, to understand relative commitment levels and avoid overcommitment as we begin using milestones.
